      <h1>iCalendar &#8212; Internet calendaring, Ruby style</h1>
<p>
This is a Ruby library for dealing with iCalendar files. Rather than
explaining myself, here is the introduction from RFC-2445, which defines
the format:
</p>
<p>
The use of calendaring and scheduling has grown considerably in the last
decade. Enterprise and inter-enterprise business has become dependent on
rapid scheduling of events and actions using this information technology.
However, the longer term growth of calendaring and scheduling, is currently
limited by the lack of Internet standards for the message content types
that are central to these knowledgeware applications. This memo is intended
to progress the level of interoperability possible between dissimilar
calendaring and scheduling applications. This memo defines a MIME content
type for exchanging electronic calendaring and scheduling information. The
Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core <a
href="../classes/Object.html">Object</a> Specification, or iCalendar,
allows for the capture and exchange of information normally stored within a
calendaring and scheduling application; such as a Personal Information
Manager (PIM) or a Group Scheduling product.
</p>
<p>
The iCalendar format is suitable as an exchange format between applications
or systems. The format is defined in terms of a MIME content type. This
will enable the object to be exchanged using several transports, including
but not limited to SMTP, HTTP, a file system, desktop interactive protocols
such as the use of a memory- based clipboard or drag/drop interactions,
point-to-point asynchronous communication, wired-network transport, or some
form of unwired transport such as infrared might also be used.
</p>
<p>
Now for some examples:
</p>
<p>
## Probably want to start with this
</p>
<pre>
  require 'rubygems' # Unless you install from the tarball or zip.
  require 'icalendar'
  require 'date'

  include Icalendar # Probably do this in your class to limit namespace overlap
</pre>
<p>
## Creating calendars and events is easy.
</p>
<pre>
  # Create a calendar with an event (standard method)
  cal = Calendar.new
  cal.event do
    dtstart       Date.new(2005, 04, 29)
    dtend         Date.new(2005, 04, 28)
    summary     &quot;Meeting with the man.&quot;
    description &quot;Have a long lunch meeting and decide nothing...&quot;
    klass       &quot;PRIVATE&quot;
  end
</pre>
<p>
## Or you can make events like this
</p>
<pre>
  event = Event.new
  event.start = DateTime.civil(2006, 6, 23, 8, 30)
  event.summary = &quot;A great event!&quot;
  cal.add_event(event)

  event2 = cal.event  # This automatically adds the event to the calendar
  event2.start = DateTime.civil(2006, 6, 24, 8, 30)
  event2.summary = &quot;Another great event!&quot;

  # Now with support for property parameters
  params = {&quot;ALTREP&quot; =&gt;['&quot;http://my.language.net&quot;'], &quot;LANGUAGE&quot; =&gt; [&quot;SPANISH&quot;]}

  cal.event do
    dtstart Date.new(2005, 04, 29)
    dtend   Date.new(2005, 04, 28)
    summary &quot;This is a summary with params.&quot;, params
  end

  # We can output the calendar as a string to write to a file,
  # network port, database etc.
  cal_string = cal.to_ical
  puts cal_string
</pre>
<h2>Parsing iCalendars:</h2>
<pre>
  # Open a file or pass a string to the parser
  cal_file = File.open(&quot;single_event.ics&quot;)

  # Parser returns an array of calendars because a single file
  # can have multiple calendars.
  cals = Icalendar.parse(cal_file)
  cal = cals.first

  # Now you can access the cal object in just the same way I created it
  event = cal.events.first

  puts &quot;start date-time: &quot; + event.dtstart
  puts &quot;summary: &quot; + event.summary
</pre>
<h2>Finders:</h2>
<p>
Often times in web apps and other interactive applications you&#8217;ll
need to lookup items in a calendar to make changes or get details. Now you
can find everything by the unique id automatically associated with all
components.
</p>
<pre>
  cal = Calendar.new
  10.times { cal.event } # Create 10 events with only default data.
  some_event = cal.events[5] # Grab it from the array of events

  # Use the uid as the key in your app
  key = some_event.uid

  # so later you can find it.
  same_event = cal.find_event(key)
</pre>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<p>
Check the unit tests for examples of most things you&#8217;ll want to do,
but please send me example code or let me know what&#8217;s missing.
